** TODO read material 
*** understand 1-16


** TODO write a parser 

Bitcoin transactions include scripts which allow the transactions to
perform actions depending on inputs. Most of these scripts are very
simple and designed to transfer funds to the owner of a private key
hence their use in transactions. Some of these scripts are complex and
interesting. Write a program (in python or C++) which parses the
Bitcoin blockchain and finds interesting, non-standard scripts. You
can use libraries and tools to perform the parsing.

There already exists a tool for doing this, but we want you to write your own.
