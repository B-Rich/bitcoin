bitcoin parsing task


# Task:
Bitcoin transactions include scripts which allow the transactions to
perform actions depending on inputs. Most of these scripts are very
simple and designed to transfer funds to the owner of a private key
hence their use in transactions. Some of these scripts are complex and
interesting. Write a program (in python or C++) which parses the
Bitcoin blockchain and finds interesting, non-standard scripts. You
can use libraries and tools to perform the parsing.

There already exists a tool for doing this, but we want you to write your own.
